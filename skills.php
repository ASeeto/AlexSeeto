        <div class="wrap"><h2>Web Developer</h2></div>
        <p>I began teaching myself HTML at a young age without even realizing what I was doing. My true purpose in learning it was to dress up the homepage of my Neopets guild. I sought out an HTML tutorial on my own. I fell in love with web development as I began to realize the limitless possibilities and tools available to me. I've since expanded my knowledge from front end development to the full stack.</p>

        <div class="wrap"><h2>Software Engineer</h2></div>
        <p>I aspire to develop software that will make a difference in the world. My coursework at Northeastern University has set the foundation for my programming abilities along with books that I have chosen to read outside of the curriculum. My work experience with software development consists of web applications, server provisioning scripts, and maintenance of a developer environment setup script. </p>

        <div class="wrap"><h2>Graphic Designer</h2></div>
        <p>I have created numerous graphics for marketing purposes whether it be flyers, banners, or logos. I served as an Executive Board member in two organizations at Northeastern University and took it upon myself to assist with their graphic design. I was ecstatic the first time one of my flyers was published and distributed around campus. Graphic design is another passion of mine that I would like to continue to refine.</p>

        My work has given me experience with full stack development, IT support, customer service, and quality assurance. I was born with an insatiable desire to learn paired with an  innate self determination and persistent work ethic. My hope in terms of career is for flexibility in order to continue branching out my knowledge in the many technical areas that  my discipline has to offer.
